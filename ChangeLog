TODO
* implement libvslvm_handle_open_physical_volume_data_files
* libvslvm_logical_volume_seek_offset fix locking issue.
* finish:
  - libvslvm_internal_logical_volume_read_buffer_from_file_io_handle
  - make sure to set the right offset in internal_logical_volume->chunks_vector 

* update manuals

Library:
* metadata
  - parse and expose global values
  - make sure metadata is cleaned on close - also if no data files were set!
  - metadata: handle trailing comment in more places?
* implement read logical volume functionality
  - stripes fill fdata stream
* implement multi strip support
* implement multi physical volume files support
  - map pv names to file IO pool?
* add support to specify metadata in external configuration file
* API
  - allow for multiple input images (physical volumes)
  - allow open to read a text file with the metadata

Python bindings:
* implement

Tools:
* vslvminfo
  - print stripes and in-volume offsets
* vslvmmount
  - allow use of names besides lvm#?
